Oral presentation for the [contributed paper](/files/aim20_fi.pdf) accepted by [IEEE AIM 2020](http://aim2020.org/). The conference was originally arranged to be held at Boston, but has been moved to a virtual one due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

In soft robotics, developing an effective way of
robot-environment interaction is a challenging task due to the
soft nature of the material that makes the manipulator. This
paper demonstrates a vision-based approach to configure a two-segment
soft continuum robot manipulator into an user-defined
configuration and interact with unknown objects on plane. The
soft robot manipulator actuated by cable-driven mechanism,
is composed of two cascade continuum segments which are
made from poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS). The overall robot
configuration can be determined in a point-wise manner on
image plane provided by an eye-to-hand system. One can define
the end-effectors’ location on the visual system to re-shape
the manipulator. The visual servoing fashion allows the robot
to optimize its posture to its best fit without developing any
complicated model. Experiments on prototype indicate that the
proposed model-free approach can be well employed, even when
the manipulator is bearing a payload. By adaptively adjusting
manipulator’s stiffness to a quasi-deadlock status, the payload
capacity is up to nearly 6 times of the manipulator’s mass itself.
