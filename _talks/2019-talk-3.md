I joined the 5th PolyU Mechanical Engineering Research Presentation Competition. It was a 3 minutes presentation challange to showcase the research work to ME colleagues (considered as gerneal audiences). Of course I have not won a prize. Here is the [photo gallary](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/the-5th-research-presentation-competition/) of that day.
