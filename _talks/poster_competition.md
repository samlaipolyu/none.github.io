I joined the 5th PolyU Mechanical Engineering Research Presentation Competition. It was a 3-minute presentation challange to showcase the research work to ME Dept professors and colleagues. The purpose was to explain the field knowledge to general audiences as clear as possible in a short time. Well... of course, I have won no prize. Here is the [photo gallary](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/the-5th-research-presentation-competition/) of that day.
