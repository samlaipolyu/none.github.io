I am a PhD student from [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) under the supervision of [Dr. Henry K. Chu](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/chu-kar-hang-henry-dr/) and the co-supervision of [Prof. Li Cheng](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/cheng-li-prof/).

My research interests include soft robotics, robot learning, computer vision, and surgical robotic system. Currently I am working on _the full-stack development_ of surgical soft-bodied continuum robot system which involves design, prototype fabrication, modeling, model-based/model-free control, and the potential applications in R-MIS.
