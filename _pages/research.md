## Soft Robotics  

_Soft Robotics_ is the specific subfield of robotics dealing with constructing robots from highly compliant materials, similar to those found in living organisms [(Trivedi, 2008)](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/abb/2008/520417/). In contrast to robots built from rigid materials, soft robots allow for increased flexibility and adaptability for accomplishing tasks, as well as improved safety when working around humans [(Rus, 2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14543.pdf). These characteristics allow for its potential use in the fields of robotic surgeries.

The aim of this project is to develop a surgical-competent miniaturized soft continuum robotic system. The project will focus on the design, control, and automation of the soft-bodied continuum robotic system.

## Verticalized-Tip Trajectory Tracking of A 3D-Printable Soft Continuum Robot: Enabling Surgical Blood Suction Automation

*Soft Robot Tip Trajectory Tracking* with its Tip Orientation remains vertical to the Ground. Configuration scheme is assigned to the soft manipulator so that it can hold its tip pointing direction while tracking a user-defined trajectory. The idea is motivated by surgical blood aspirator, which in the current stage, a manual-tool manipulated by assistant surgeon. The aim is to design an automated blood suction soft manipulator for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (RMIS). A paper entitled *Verticalized-Tip Trajectory Tracking of A 3D-Printable Soft Continuum Robot: Enabling Surgical Blood Suction Automation* is going to submit to T-MECH.
